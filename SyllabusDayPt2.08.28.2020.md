### Course goals
- Levels of abstraction
	- Very low-level to very high-level
	- Modeling data and programs
	- Highest level: real-world problem
	- Lowest level: machine level representation
- Implementing basic and advanced data structures in C++
	- Like...
		- Linked list
		- Stack
		- Queue
		- Hash tables
		- Heaps
		- Trees
		- Graphs
		- etc.
	- Done to deepen our understanding
	- Why do we care about these datastructures?
	- Well....
		- Time complexity
			- Choosing the correct datastructure for the task at hand can cause significant speedups with sufficient input size
- Talk about time and space complexity using asymptotic language
- Talk about program execution model; underlying hardware and software
- Implement basic control and data structures in x86 assembler

### Complaints from previous semesters
- Hard class (oof)
